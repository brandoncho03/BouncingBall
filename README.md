# BouncingBall
This is my README.md for my project.

I utilizing a prexisting program with bouncing balls made by one of the professors. I wanted to add some flair to it so I did some customization. 

1. The first change I made was changing the music. I added one of my favorite minecraft soundtracks which I think relaly helps iwth the ambiance of the atmosphere of a space theme.

2. The second change I made was to add an astronaut img onto the screen. I had to resize it and format him to be in the middle. He's chilling and having a good time with the bouncing balls.

3. Third change was learning how to add a sound effect when an object was clicked. 

4. My 4th change was in case the first change was not a big enough one. I added a button and a sound effect plays upon clicking on it.

I actaully really enjoyed this small activity. It was short and sweet and I had fun completing it.
